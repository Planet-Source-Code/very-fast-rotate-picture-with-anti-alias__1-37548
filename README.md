### Description

You Gotta Check This Out! Rotate a picture any angle -359.999° to 359.999° with or without Anti-Alias effect. I have coded it 3 different ways to show you the advantages and disadvantages of various graphics routines. First example rotates from 1 picture to another using Point and Pset. The second one uses GetPixel and SetPixel APIs. The third, a very fast technique using GetDiBits and SetDiBits (The fastest way to rotate a picture using API). Also includes my CodeTimer class which is useful for benchmarking your code. It is returns values in milliseconds accurate to 2 decimal places (10 nanoseconds). I have put in TONS of comments and optimized the code to its fullest potential. It is even possible to rotate a picture in realtime! Update - Point/Pset and GetPixel/SetPixel are now even faster.
